// Opt-in failures ("What if something fails?"): what the picker lists, what each pick plays, and the what-if run
// itself. Host-agnostic: main.js passes the page's side effects in `host`, test/run.mjs and test/build.mjs stubs.
//
// A prompt opts in with at least one TOP-LEVEL { failPoint: name } in its steps (a no-op in a normal run). Its clean
// run is the default and ends with its { end } step; the visitor picks a failure from its success end card. Scene data:
//   devices[id].ref       how NCB names the device mid-sentence ("the floor lamp", "Mirror M2")
//   prompt.genericAt      failPoint where a device the request doesn't use fails (default: the first failPoint)
//   prompt.genericTitle   the alert title of that engine-generated failure (default '⚠ Device down'; a title starting
//                         with 📝 shows as a calm note, js/engine/chat.js)
//   prompt.whatIf[id]     a device of the scene stops working: { at?, intro?, ask?, steps, alsoFaults? }
//   prompt.whatIf[key]    a special (key is not a device id): { label, ask, at?, intro?, steps, alsoFaults? }
//     at          the failPoint the replay stops before (default: the prompt's first failPoint)
//     intro       NCB's opening line (default: "Replaying this request. This time, <ref> fails during the run." for a
//                 device, "Replaying this request. This time: <label, first letter lower-cased>." for a special)
//     ask         the visitor's bubble (default for a device: "What if <ref> fails?")
//     label       the picker button of a special
//     steps       the scenario, in the step DSL (js/engine/player.js), ending with its { end } card (the last step). No
//                 { beat } steps: runWhatIf() puts { beat: 'recover' } before them. It updates the status line (a status
//                 step, a label, ctx.status or a fail) before NCB first speaks, so "Replaying this request…" goes then.
//     alsoFaults  other device ids the scenario may leave in 'fault' (tests)
// A device with no entry gets the engine-generated scenario below (the tests check it really is unused).

// `quiet` flag of build(), A2); host.clearMarkers() runs right after it. If the visitor answers a plan card in the
// scenario with "Not this", nothing more of it runs: NCB says so and the engine's own end card closes the what-if.
